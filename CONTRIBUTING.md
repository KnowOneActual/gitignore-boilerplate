# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Scope of this Project

The goal of this repository is to provide a **general-purpose** boilerplate. We want to keep it lightweight and relevant for most developers.

**Please do not** open Pull Requests for:
* Highly specific or obscure IDE plugins.
* Personal workflow scripts (like custom shell scripts).
* Files that are better suited for a global `.gitignore`.

If you think an ignore rule is missing that affects a broad range of users (like a new common framework or a standard OS file), we would love to see it.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a file that shouldn't be ignored, or one that *should* be but isn't, please open an issue to discuss it.

### Submitting Changes
1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Make sure your changes follow the existing style (check `.editorconfig`).
3.  Add your changes to `.gitignore`.
4.  Open a Pull Request with a clear title and description.
